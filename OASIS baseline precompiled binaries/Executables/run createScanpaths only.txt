Use createScanpaths.exe for both layer and scan generation.  It will prompt you to select a configuration file (version 3 only) in whatever folder you like.  The STL files used by that project must be in the same folder as its config file

The other two executables (genLayer and genScan) are helper functions called by createScanpaths
